        <h1>The <span class="name">Tiger</span> And The <span class="an_namee">Lion</span></h1>
        <p>A <span class="name"><b>Tiger </b></span> was making fun of the <span class="an_namee"><b>Lion </b></span> one
            day for being
            so slow.</p>
        <p>"Do you ever get
            anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="yes"><b>"Yes"</b></span> replied the <span class="an_namee"><b>Lion </b></span> "and I get there
            <span class="speed"><b> quicker </b></span> than you think. I'll
            run you a race and prove it."</p>
        <p>The <span class="name"><b>Tiger </b></span> was much <span class="adjective"><b>alarmed </b></span> at the idea
            of
            running a race with the <span class="an_namee"><b>Lion</b></span>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed,
            So the
            <span class="one_more"><b>Dog</b></span>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,
            <span class="quote"><b> "example".</b></span>
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="name"><b>Tiger </b></span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span
                class="an_namee"><b>Lion </b></span> feel very deeply
            how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <span class="name"><b>Tiger </b></span>, he went off the
            course
            to practice
            <span class="verb"><b>running </b></span> for <span class="number"><b>2 </b></span> hours until the <span
                class="an_namee"><b> Lion </b></span> should catch up.</p>
        <p>The
            <span class="an_namee"><b> Lion </b></span> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and after a time passd
            the
            place where the
            <span class="name"><b> Tiger </b></span> was <span class="verb"><b>running </b></span> and when at last he did
            stop, the <span class="an_namee"><b>Lion </b></span> was near
            the goal. The <span class="name"><b>Tiger </b></span> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the
            <span class="an_namee"><b>Lion </b></span> in
            time.</p>
